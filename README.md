Tpett's vim configuration
=========================

Thanks to these guys:

* [Gary Bernhardt](http://destroyallsoftware.com),
* [Drew Neil](http://vimcasts.org),
* [Tim Pope](http://tbaggery.com),
* [Mislav](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/),
* and the [Janus project](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus).

My configuration uses [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and git submodules.
(But you don't need to care about any of that.)

## Plugins

I use several open-source plugins that are added as submodules.

### Features

* __bufexplorer__ :: Provides a nice buffer management interface
* __commentary__ :: Simple comment/uncomment feature
* __endwise__ :: Smart non-intrusive auto-closing of code blocks
* __fugitive__ :: Kick awesome git plugin
* __gundo__ :: Undo tree management
* __powerline__ :: Super sexy status bar
* __surround__ :: Manipulate containing structures

### Lang / Syntax / Color
